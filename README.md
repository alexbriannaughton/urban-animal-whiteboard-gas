I develop and maintain a Google Apps Script for [Urban Animal](https://urbananimalnw.com/) which integrates an internal tool with our veterinary EHR, [ezyVet](https://www.ezyvet.com/). I also work the front desk : ) 

The project utilizes Google Sheets, Google Cloud Platform, webhooks from ezyVet's fab API, and Javascript.

The Google Sheet, AKA the "White Board", is a living, breathing representation of all of the pets that are actively within the care of Urban Animal, one of the largest veterinary practices in Seattle. The spreadsheet, which is used across 3 locations by more than 100 Urban Animal employees, helps to manage the care of the 20-70 dogs and cats that are generally on site at any given moment.
