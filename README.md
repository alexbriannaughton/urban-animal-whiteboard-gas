Independently developing a Google Sheet integration a veterinary hospital's CRM. The project utilizes Google Apps Script, Google Web Apps, Google Cloud Platform, webhooks, ezyVet's API, and Javascript.

The Google Sheet is living, breathing representation of all of the pets that are actively within the care of Urban Animal, one of the largest veterinary practices in Seattle with three locations throughout the city. The Sheet keeps track of the 20-70 pets actively within the hospital's care at all times.

Currently in implementation phase.
